# 531

5/3/1 is an exercise routine where you prioritize lifting few reps but heavy weight for your "Big 4 Exercises" which include squats, deadlift, shoulder press, and bench press. Since at the time I did not find too many excel sheets for this routine I decided to make one. With the scope of the application being small I thought it is a decent use case to build.

This Android application was built using Java. It was a good learning experience but I learned to avoid spending time on making these forms of applications for practical reasons as with things like workout routines and diets they change fairly consistently if you're still figuring out what works for you. If you're convinced this routine will be used for the next couple of years with few changes an application is useful. Otherwise, google sheets and excel handle 95% of your use case so there is no harm in using it to begin with.
